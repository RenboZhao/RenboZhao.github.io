== Research Interests
Theory and computational practice for *continuous optimization algorithms*, with applications in 
*machine learning*, *data science* and *operations management*. 
# My recent  research is on optimization algorithms for  convex, nonconvex and stochastic optimization. 

#Looking ahead I am eager to explore topics in optimization under 
#uncertainty, online learning, and reinforcement learning. \n\n
#My publications can be found [http://web.mit.edu/renboz/www/pub.html here].
